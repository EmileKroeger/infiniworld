InfiniWorld, an infinite procedural map in JavaScript.

See live: http://mremile.pythonanywhere.com/

This project is built using Yeoman (http://yeoman.io/) and the angular-flask Generator (https://github.com/rayokota/generator-angular-flask) - though as of January 2016 all the important code is client-side (flask is not used, only static content is).
 
Other ressources used:

 * Some text extracted from Abulafia (http://random-generator.com)
 * The "Symbola" font (from https://zhm.github.io/symbola/)

You may find more information on the project on my blog: https://themadmapmaker.wordpress.com/.
